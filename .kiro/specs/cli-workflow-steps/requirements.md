# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the mortgage processing CLI to support selective workflow step execution. Currently, the CLI workflow process command fails when additional arguments are provided, and users cannot specify which specific workflow steps to run. This enhancement will allow users to specify individual workflow steps (like income_verification, risk_assessment, etc.) as arguments to control which parts of the mortgage processing workflow are executed.

## Glossary

- **CLI**: Command Line Interface for the mortgage processing system
- **Workflow_Process_Command**: The `workflow process` command in the CLI that processes mortgage applications
- **Workflow_Steps**: Individual processing steps like income_verification, risk_assessment, property_assessment, document_processing, credit_assessment, and underwriting
- **Mortgage_Processing_System**: The overall system that processes mortgage applications through various agents and tools
- **Step_Selection**: The ability to specify which workflow steps should be executed during processing

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mortgage processing operator, I want to specify which workflow steps to run when processing an application, so that I can focus on specific aspects of the application or rerun only certain steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides workflow step names as arguments to the workflow process command, THE Workflow_Process_Command SHALL accept and validate those step names
2. WHERE step names are provided, THE Workflow_Process_Command SHALL execute only the specified Workflow_Steps
3. IF invalid step names are provided, THEN THE Workflow_Process_Command SHALL display an error message listing valid step names
4. WHERE no step names are provided, THE Workflow_Process_Command SHALL execute all available Workflow_Steps as it currently does
5. THE Workflow_Process_Command SHALL support the following step names: income_verification, risk_assessment, property_assessment, document_processing, credit_assessment, underwriting

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a mortgage processing operator, I want clear error messages when I provide invalid arguments, so that I can correct my command and successfully process applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid arguments are provided to the workflow process command, THE Workflow_Process_Command SHALL display a helpful error message
2. THE Workflow_Process_Command SHALL list all valid workflow step names in error messages
3. IF the command fails due to argument parsing, THEN THE Workflow_Process_Command SHALL exit with a non-zero status code
4. THE Workflow_Process_Command SHALL validate step names before starting any processing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a mortgage processing operator, I want the output file to be created successfully when specified, so that I can review processing results in a structured format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an output file is specified with the --output option, THE Workflow_Process_Command SHALL create the output file upon successful completion
2. IF the output file cannot be created, THEN THE Workflow_Process_Command SHALL display an error message and exit with non-zero status
3. THE Workflow_Process_Command SHALL include information about which steps were executed in the output file
4. WHERE selective steps are executed, THE Workflow_Process_Command SHALL indicate in the output which steps were skipped
